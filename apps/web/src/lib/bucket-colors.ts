 * port this migration to `apps/mobile`). Hex values MUST match the Tailwind

 * `--color-ahorro`/`--color-exceso`) — kept as literal hex here (not
 * `var(--color-...)`) because this module also feeds the pure
 * `resumen-view-model` (no DOM, no CSS cascade available).
 *
 * These four hexes were minted for the retired light "Serene Finance"
 * identity and OUTLIVED it: the Tecno-Analítico restyle (2026-09-02)
 * deliberately left them alone because they are mid-tone and still clear
 * 7.94-13.10:1 as fills on the dark ground (per-token table in `index.css`).
 * They are named for the buckets, not for an identity — do not assume a
 * future identity change has to move them, and do not assume it can't.

/**
 * Focus-ring contrast against these pastels — canonical source (the numbers
 * live HERE ONLY; `DistribucionPie.tsx`, `LeyendaGasto.tsx` and
 * `ResumenAnual.tsx` point back to this comment instead of repeating them).
 *
 * ⚠️ REWRITTEN 2026-09-03. Round 9 routed every focus state through `--ring`
 * and recorded that contrast "can only improve". That held while `--ring` was
 * #1A1C1C — a dark ring on light pastels. The Tecno-Analítico restyle moved
 * `--ring` to cyan #67E8F9, which INVERTED the conclusion for anything drawn
 * on a pastel. Current ratios:
 *
 * | Pastel fill                | --ring #1A1C1C (old) | --ring #67E8F9 (now) |
 * | -------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
 * | Necesidades   (#8FA7D1)    | 7.02:1               | 1.68:1               |
 * | Deseos/Gustos (#B1A7D1)    | 7.60:1               | 1.55:1               |
 * | Ahorro        (#E6D194)    | 11.34:1              | 1.04:1               |
 * | Sin categoría (#AEB4C4)    | 8.25:1               | 1.43:1               |
 *
 * On the app's own surfaces the trade runs the other way — cyan is 12.80:1 on
 * `--card`, 13.64:1 on `--background`, where #1A1C1C was ~1.1:1. Neither tone
 * serves both, and no third one does either: clearing 3:1 against #E6D194
 * caps relative luminance at 0.093 while clearing 3:1 against `--background`
 * needs ≥0.113, so the interval is EMPTY.
 *
 * What this means per consumer:
 * - `LeyendaGasto` / `ResumenAnual`: their focus rings sit on `--card`, never
 *   on a pastel (the pastel is a small dot INSIDE the row, not the row's
 *   background). Cyan at 12.80:1 — fine, nothing to do.
 * - `DistribucionPie`: its wedges ARE the pastel, and `outline` on an SVG
 *   path draws around the bounding box, which crosses them. That one needed a
 *   TWO-TONE indicator; the full derivation is at its call site.
 *
 * So "route every focus state through --ring" is still the house grammar, but
 * it is no longer sufficient on its own wherever the ring lands on a pastel.
