/**
 * PatronFila (US-043 PR #4, design.md §1/Q9b, WCTG-04, WCTG-09, WCTG-13) —
 * one pattern row inside `PatronesSection`. Two independently `<label>`-
 * associated controls (`Tipo de coincidencia` `<select>`, `Patrón`
 * `<input>`) that commit IMMEDIATELY, per row — never batched with
 * `Guardar` (WCTG-04's second, independent commit surface).
 *
 * **Redesign (judgment-day, 2026-08-14, after three fix rounds each of
 * which opened the next round's defect — see `docs/adr/` change log for the
 * full account)**: the frozen spec (`specs/web-app/spec.md`) only requires
 * patterns to commit "the moment each row action is confirmed" — it never
 * said `blur`. The three previous rounds all treated `blur` as ONE
 * ambiguous commit trigger shared by both a not-yet-created row and an
 * existing one, then patched each new misfire individually. This version
 * splits the two cases instead:
 *
 * - **A not-yet-created row** (`patron` prop absent, design.md §1/Q9a) does
 *   **not** commit on blur AT ALL — its first commit is an EXPLICIT confirm
 *   (the `Confirmar patrón` button, Enter in `Patrón`, or picking a
 *   `matchType` once `Patrón` already has text — all discrete, deliberate
 *   actions, unlike `blur`, which fires just as often when the user is
 *   merely leaving the field). This kills the entire "delete races an
 *   in-flight create" class structurally: a not-yet-created row can ALWAYS
 *   be discarded via `onDescartar` with **zero** network calls from a gesture
 *   that ever touched THIS row — nothing auto-creates behind the user's back
 *   from a `blur`, a stray keystroke, or an unrelated field on this same row.
 *   (`confirmarAlGuardar` below is the one deliberate exception: `Guardar`,
 *   a gesture elsewhere on the screen, CAN create this row — see that
 *   section's docblock for why that is still safe, since the delete button
 *   is already `disabled` the instant that create starts.)
 *
 *   **`Confirmar patrón` (issue #600, 2026-09-08)**: the redesign above was
 *   right to demand an explicit confirm, but it shipped only INVISIBLE ones
 *   — a keystroke and a side effect of changing another field. A reporter
 *   typed a pattern, pressed the `Guardar` of the identity form (which by
 *   `PatronesSection`'s §1/Q3b DOM boundary never touches patterns), and
 *   lost the row on the next reload with no request ever sent and no signal
 *   given. An explicit gesture the user cannot see is not explicit. This
 *   button gives that same commit a visible surface, next to the row's
 *   delete icon and following its idiom (`CLASE_BOTON_ICONO` + `FOCUS_RING`
 *   + `aria-label`); Enter and the `matchType` path stay as shortcuts. It
 *   renders ONLY on a not-yet-created row — an existing row already commits
 *   on blur, so a second trigger there would be redundant, not clearer.
 *   It is `disabled` while `Patrón` is blank or whitespace-only, mirroring
 *   `commit()`'s own blank guard: a control that silently does nothing when
 *   pressed is precisely the defect being closed here.
 *
 *   **`confirmarAlGuardar` (issue #600 follow-up, 2026-09-09)**: `Confirmar
 *   patrón` gave the explicit confirm a VISIBLE surface, but the reporter
 *   came back having pressed `Guardar` again — the control that promises,
 *   by its own name, to save everything on screen. `PatronesSection`'s
 *   §1/Q3b DOM boundary is not being revisited (a not-yet-created row still
 *   never commits on blur), but `Guardar` gains a THIRD way to reach the
 *   SAME `commit()` the button and Enter already use. `EditarCategoria`
 *   bumps a plain counter on every `Guardar` click and threads it down to
 *   not-yet-created rows only; a CHANGE in that number (not a specific
 *   value) is the signal a `useEffect` below reacts to — the declarative
 *   sibling of a ref-based imperative handle, but without exposing this
 *   row's internals to its parent (`solid`'s ISP: `PatronesSection` only
 *   ever passes a number down, never calls a method on this row). The
 *   effect defers to the SAME `commit()` used by every other trigger, so
 *   every one of its guards — blank value, demo, an external dialog open,
 *   this row's own mutation already in flight — applies here for free, with
 *   zero new conditionals.
 * - **An existing row** (`patron` id known) keeps commit-on-blur-or-Enter —
 *   delete is always well-defined here (there is always a server id). The
 *   remaining ambiguity — Tab-ing onto the delete button must still commit
 *   the edit, but a real CLICK on it must not fire a save the user is about
 *   to discard — is resolved by tracking genuine POINTER intent
 *   (`onMouseDown` on the delete button, which always precedes a real
 *   click but never a Tab landing), not by inspecting `blur`'s
 *   `relatedTarget` (round 2's approach, which conflated the two: it also
 *   ate a keyboard user's edit on a plain Tab, no signal given).
 *
 * Mutation success bodies are discarded everywhere in this feature (Q2a),
 * so this component can never learn a freshly `POST`ed pattern's server id
 * from the response — on success it asks the parent to drop the local-only
 * placeholder (`onDescartar`); the persisted row then appears through
 * `PatronesSection`'s normal render of `categoria.patrones` once profile
 * A's invalidation refetches `['categorias']`.
 *
 * **Resync from `patron`**: local `valor`/`matchType` seed once from props
 * but ALSO resync whenever the incoming `patron.patron`/`patron.matchType`
 * diverge from what this row last knew as committed (e.g. a background
 * `['categorias']` refetch) — but ONLY when the user has no unsaved local
 * edit (`valor`/`matchType` still equal the last-committed baseline). An
 * active, unsaved edit is never clobbered by a refetch.
 *
 * **A blank commit reverts, it doesn't freeze**: clearing an EXISTING row's
 * `Patrón` to blank and leaving the field is a no-op (no request — a blank
 * pattern is meaningless), but the display now reverts to the last
 * committed text instead of staying blank forever, permanently diverged
 * from the still-live server value. A not-yet-created row has nothing to
 * revert to, so it just stays blank.
 *
 * **Focus restoration**: setting `disabled` on a focused native control
 * blurs it to `<body>` synchronously — the Enter-commit path re-disables
 * `Patrón` while its mutation is in flight, so without this, every
 * Enter-commit silently drops the user's place. Mirrors
 * `EditarCategoria`'s `restaurarFocoGuardarRef` (a ref flag + a `useEffect`
 * keyed on the fields being re-enabled, deferring `.focus()` until React
 * has actually committed `disabled: false`).
 *
 * **REGEX pre-validation is a hint, not a gate** (design.md §1/Q9b): the
 * browser's `RegExp` engine is not guaranteed to match the server's, so a
 * client-side *block* would refuse patterns the API would accept (ADR-024).
 * An inline `role="status"` hint renders when `matchType === 'REGEX'` and
 * the current text fails `new RegExp(...)`, but the commit path is
 * untouched.
 *
 * **Delete fires with no confirmation dialog** — a pattern touches no
 * persisted transaction (`CAT038-04` does not apply; a confirmation for a
 * reversible one-field edit is friction, not safety). Both this row's icon
 * buttons carry `CLASE_BOTON_ICONO` (`estilos.ts`, WCAG 2.2 AA SC 2.5.8).
 *
 * This sentence used to claim "third and final usage of `CLASE_BOTON_ICONO`".
 * That counter had already rotted before this change — `BotonVolver`,
 * `FilaRevision` and `NuevaCategoriaDesdeFilaForm` all adopted the constant
 * afterwards — and the `Confirmar patrón` button below would only have moved
 * a wrong number to a different wrong number. The `dry` 3-strike rule was
 * satisfied when the constant was first extracted; re-pinning a running
 * total in a file that cannot see its own call sites is what broke, so the
 * count is gone rather than bumped (`rg CLASE_BOTON_ICONO` is the answer).
 *
 * Errors from any of the three mutations render `mensajeDeErrorCatalogo` in
 * a `role="alert"` — the same closed-table discipline as every other
 * mutation surface in this feature (never a server-supplied string).
 *
 * **`onAnunciar` (judgment-day round 2 WARNING)**: optional callback fired
 * with a Spanish sentence on every successful mutation (`crear`/
 * `actualizar`/`eliminar`). This component does NOT render its own
 * `aria-live` region any more — see `PatronesSection`'s docblock for why
 * (the region has to survive this row's own unmount, which a per-row span
 * cannot).

  // Redesign (structural causes #1 and #2, see this component's docblock):
  // a not-yet-created row's FIRST commit must be an EXPLICIT confirm (the
  // `Confirmar patrón` button, Enter, or picking `matchType` once `Patrón`
  // already has text) — `blur` never commits it, full stop, regardless of
  // where focus goes next. An
  // EXISTING row keeps commit-on-blur, but must still distinguish a genuine
  // CLICK on the delete button (skip the commit — the row is about to be
  // discarded anyway) from a Tab landing on it (commit — Tab is not a
  // discard signal). `clicEliminarEnCursoRef` (set by the button's own
  // `onMouseDown`) carries that intent; a bare `relatedTarget` check cannot,
  // because it fires identically for both.
  //
  // Judgment-day round 3 WARNING: skipping the commit outright the moment
  // the flag is seen `true` assumed a real `click` was always about to
  // follow — false on a 24×24 target, where the pointer can drag off the
  // button before release. `mousedown`+`blur` always fire together (this
  // component relies on the browser focusing the button on `mousedown`),
  // but `click` only fires if `mouseup` also lands on the button — so this
  // handler can't yet tell the two cases apart. Defer the decision instead
  // of deciding it here: `eliminarFila`'s `onClick` runs SYNCHRONOUSLY,
  // before any `setTimeout(0)` macrotask, so it always wins the race and
  // clears the flag first when a click genuinely lands; if no click lands,
  // this replays the commit that was provisionally skipped, instead of
  // silently dropping the user's edit.

    // not by accident:
    //
    // - `alCambiarMatchType` resets it to `false` because focus legitimately
    //   belongs to the `<select>` the user just operated — yanking it to
    //   `Patrón` would steal it from a control they are still using.
    // - This button and Enter both DESTROY the focus they were activated
    //   from: `accionesBloqueadas` disables the button (and the input) the
    //   instant the mutation starts, and a real browser blurs a focused
    //   control to `<body>` synchronously when it is disabled (see this
    //   component's docblock, "Focus restoration"). There is no focus left
    //   to preserve — only a place to put it back.
    //
    // On the FAILURE path the row stays mounted and a `role="alert"` appears;
    // `Patrón` is where the user has to go to fix the pattern, so that is
    // where focus belongs. Resetting to `false` here (the first cut of this
    // fix) left the VISIBLE affordance stranding focus on `<body>` while the
    // invisible Enter shortcut restored it — backwards, given this button
    // exists precisely to be the discoverable path. On the SUCCESS path the
    // row unmounts via `onDescartar` and `inputPatronRef.current?.focus()`
