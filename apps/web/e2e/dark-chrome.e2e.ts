/**
 * e2e/dark-chrome.e2e.ts — guards the two lines of the Tecno-Analítico
 * restyle (2026-09-02) that NOTHING else can see.
 *
 * Both live in `apps/web/src/index.css` and both were found by looking at a
 * screenshot, not by a failing test — the whole unit suite (1744 tests), lint,
 * `tsc` and the production build were green while the app rendered native
 * `<select>` controls with a light face on the matte-dark ground:
 *
 * 1. `color-scheme: dark` on `:root`. It was first written on `body`, where
 *    it still INHERITS down to every control — so the element computed
 *    `dark` and looked correct to any check that asked the element. The UA,
 *    however, reads the ROOT element's used value to theme the viewport
 *    canvas and its native widgets, and root computed `normal`. Asserting on
 *    the `<select>` alone would NOT have caught it; this spec asserts on
 *    `document.documentElement` for exactly that reason.
 * 2. `select, option { background-color: var(--card) }` in `@layer base`.
 *    The app's two native selects (`CampoSelect`,
 *    `ReclasificarCategoriaControl`) set a text colour and a border but no
 *    background, so the face fell through to the UA widget theme.
 *
 * Why e2e and not jsdom: jsdom does not paint, does not resolve `@layer base`
 * UA-default interactions, and has no notion of `color-scheme` widget
 * theming — the same reason `playwright.config.ts` runs `vite preview` of the
 * PRODUCTION build rather than `vite dev` for every CSS claim in this suite.
 *
 * Failure mode this exists to catch: a future CSS cleanup (consolidating
 * `@layer base`, or adopting a shadcn `Select` primitive and deleting the
 * native-control rule as "dead") silently drops either line and the dropdowns
 * revert to a light OS-themed face inside a dark app. Nothing else reports it.
 *
 * `web-theme-switch` S3: `.dark` (statically applied to `<html>`, PR9 makes
 * it dynamic) now carries the Tinta cálida identity, so the expected card
 * literal below moved from Tecno-Analítico's `#11131a` to Tinta cálida's
 * `#22211e`. `color-scheme: dark` itself is unaffected — both identities are
 * dark, only their values change.
 *
 * S7b (PR11): the selector is live and no preference is stored (default
 * `system`), so each test emulates the OS scheme it needs via
 * `page.emulateMedia` BEFORE navigating — Playwright's own default is
 * `light`, so dark is no longer reached by default the way the S6 forced
 * lever guaranteed it.
